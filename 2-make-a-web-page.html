      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>Comedy is something near and dear to my heart. I tried to make it big. But then I didn't. No worries, though.</p>
      <p>The following is the structure I've given to comedy over the years.</p>
      <h3>Jimmy's Informal Definition and High Level Analysis</h3>
      <p>Informal defintion - Comedy is merely an unmet expectation that evokes or results in a positive response. There was a book I read that said that comedy started in our early hunting days. If we thought a threat was coming, but it turned out to be something tiny or non-threatening, we'd laugh. There's probably a better definition somewhere.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The setup - The comic gives you the information.</li>
        <li>The calculation - The comic gives you time to calculate your expectation.</li>
        <li>The punchline - The comic defies your expectation resulting in a tickled funny bone. Guffaws abound.</li>
      </ol>
